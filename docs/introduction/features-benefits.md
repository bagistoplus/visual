# Features and Benefits

Bagisto Visual simplifies theme development and customization in Bagisto — built for both **developers** and **merchants**. With a visual editor and structured framework, it makes building and managing storefronts faster, easier, and more collaborative.

## Key Features

### 1. **Visual Theme Editor**

A powerful drag-and-drop interface where merchants customize their storefront without touching code.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Real-Time Preview** – See exactly what you're building as you build it
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface** – Add, remove, and reorder content visually
- **No Code Required** – Designed for non-technical users

**What merchants can do:** Customize layouts, rearrange content, change colors and typography, manage sections, and build unique storefronts — all visually in the editor.

### 2. **Modern Theme Framework**

A structured, maintainable foundation for building Bagisto themes that scale.

**Architecture benefits:**

- **Modular Structure** – Clean folder layout for layouts, templates, sections, and assets
- **Section-Based Architecture** – Organize your theme into reusable sections (Hero, Features, Product Grid, Footer)
- **Blade & Livewire Support** – Build custom sections using familiar Laravel tools

**For developers:** Build themes faster with less code duplication. Create reusable components that work across multiple projects. Maintain consistency while enabling merchant customization.

### 3. **Reusable Components**

Build once, use everywhere. Create components that work across your entire theme.

**Component features:**

- **Blocks System** – Reusable building blocks that work in any section
- **Custom Sections** – Build new sections in Blade or Livewire
- **Settings & Configuration** – Define what merchants can customize
- **Cross-Theme Compatibility** – Share components between projects
- **Update Once, Change Everywhere** – Modifications propagate automatically

**Real example:** Create a button component once, use it in Hero sections, product pages, banners, and CTAs. Update the style once, every instance updates automatically.

## Benefits

### 1. **Put Merchants in Control**

Merchants can update their site without needing a developer for every minor change — saving time and improving agility.

### 2. **Faster Development Cycles**

Developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel for every project.
The framework enables rapid theme creation, reuse, and extension.

### 3. **Reduces Costs**

Since merchants can manage most of their design changes independently, it reduces the number of hours developers need to spend on small updates. This leads to a significant reduction in costs over time.

### 4. **Flexible & Customer-Centric Design**

Themes are fully customizable via templates and sections, allowing teams to create storefronts that align with brand identity and deliver a great user experience.
