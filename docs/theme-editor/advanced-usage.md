# Advanced Usage

Once you're comfortable using the Visual Editor, there are a few advanced features and tips that can help you get even more control over your storefront.

## Layout vs. Page Content

Not all sections are the same:

- **Header and Footer sections** are part of the layout and appear on every page.
- **Main Content sections** are unique to the specific page you're editing (like the homepage or contact page).

Layout sections usually cannot be removed or reordered. They’re designed to stay consistent across the entire site.

## Working with Blocks

Some sections (like category grids or image banners) contain **blocks** — small pieces of content inside the section.

You can:

- Click a section to reveal its blocks
- Add new blocks (if allowed)
- Rearrange or delete them
- Customize each block’s settings (text, images, links, etc.)

> 🖼️ _Screenshot suggestion:_ Highlight a section with editable blocks (like a “Features” or “Image with Text” section).

## Preview Tools

At the top of the editor, you’ll find useful controls:

- **Device preview**: See how your page looks on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Language switcher**: If your store supports multiple languages, preview translations
- **Page selector**: Quickly switch between pages (homepage, contact, product, etc.)

> 🖼️ _Screenshot suggestion:_ Annotate the toolbar showing device toggle and language switch.

## Best Practices

- **Edit in small steps** — Changes save automatically, so there's no need to rush.
- **Use meaningful section names** — It helps you and your team stay organized.
- **Keep it consistent** — Reuse similar section types across pages to create a cohesive design.
- **Preview before publishing** — Always test how things look on mobile and tablet before going live.
