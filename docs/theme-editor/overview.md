- Change images, text, buttons, colors, and layout options
- Reorder content by dragging and dropping sections
- Preview how your store looks on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Customize each page individually (like homepage, contact, etc.)

## Sections, Pages & Themes

- Your storefront is built using **sections**
- Each page (homepage, contact, etc.) can have different sections
- Some sections (like header or footer) appear on every page
- You can preview and switch between different pages right from the editor
